   <h2>Privacy Policy for Find My Car</h2>
<p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Find My Car ("the app") is a simple parking location saver. This policy explains what data the app uses and why.</p>

<h3>Data We Collect</h3>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> The app accesses your device's GPS location only when you tap "I Parked Here." Your location is saved locally on your device only. It is never transmitted to our servers because we don't have any.</p>

<p><strong>Photos:</strong> If you choose to add a photo of your parking spot, that photo is stored locally on your device. It is never uploaded or shared.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Any text notes you add are stored locally on your device only.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Services — Google AdMob</h3>
<p>The app displays ads served by Google AdMob. Google may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve personalized ads. You can review Google's privacy policy at: https://policies.google.com/privacy</p>

<p>On iOS, you will be asked for permission to track before personalized ads are shown. You can change this at any time in Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking.</p>

<h3>Data Storage</h3>
<p>All your parking data (location, photos, notes) is stored locally on your device using iOS standard storage. Deleting the app removes all data.</p>

<h3>Data Sharing</h3>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with anyone. No data leaves your device except through Google AdMob's ad network as described above.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>The app does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>If this policy changes, we will update the date at the top of this page.</p>
